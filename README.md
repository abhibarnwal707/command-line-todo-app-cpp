# Command-Line To-Do List Application (C++)
![C++ Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue)

This is a simple command-line to-do list application written in C++. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, viewing, and removing them from the to-do list. The application uses a vector to store the tasks, and the tasks will be reset each time the program ends (no persistence by default).

## Features

- Add tasks to the to-do list.
- View the current list of tasks.
- Remove tasks by their index.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

### Compilation

To compile the application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o todo_app todo_app.cpp
